# Half Joke Twitter Bot
The [@DadJokeyBot](https://twitter.com/DadJokeyBot) tweets out different jokes that are just half of the jokes. It's either the punchline, or not the punchline, can you guess which ones are which? (It posts once every week to allow for time to add new half jokes)

# The Bible Sonnet
The files contained in the `sonnetgenerator` folder produce a 14 line sonnet, with rhyme scheme being ABBAABBA CDECDE. This rhyme scheme has limitations, as if the last word on any line that is the basis for the rhyme scheme, such as the last word on the last line or the last word on the second line, does not have any rhyming words within the rest of the document imported, the line finishes its sentence without it rhyming. Both the `.ipynb` and `.py` files are contained in the folder.

# Glitched at The Beach
The gallery of pixelsorted images and FFglitched videos can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/jxCPYYN). The theme for this gallery is, quite obviously once you stare at it, the beach. I think the images turned out pretty well, but the FFglitched videos turned out very well, I love the effect the beach has on the average motion vector method. Enjoy!

## My Revision Process
I definitely would describe myself as not a very creative person, and these projects in general on the first attempts put me way beyond my comfort zone and encouraged me to think abstractly. I think I achieved a decent amount for not being well practiced in creativity such as this, so I decided to stick with what I've been experimenting with and what I've enjoyed the most over the semester to revise and post here. Honestly, my revision process was just me having fun over the course of a couple of weekday nights, especially the sonnet because I just revised a few things and cleaned my code and comments up so that it looked clean. I thought most of everything posted here came out pretty well and representative of the work and effort I've put into the semester, so I hope you enjoy looking through it!
