# Half Joke Twitter Bot
The [@DadJokeyBot](https://twitter.com/DadJokeyBot) tweets out different jokes that are just half of the jokes. It's either the punchline, or not the punchline, can you guess which ones are which? (It posts once every week to allow for time to add new half jokes)

# The Bible Sonnet
The files contained in the `sonnetgenerator` folder produce a 14 line sonnet, with rhyme scheme being ABBAABBA CDECDE. This rhyme scheme has limitations, as if the last word on any line that is the basis for the rhyme scheme, such as the last word on the last line or the last word on the second line, does not have any rhyming words within the rest of the document imported, the line finishes its sentence without it rhyming. Both the `.ipynb` and `.py` files are contained in the folder.

# Glitched at The Beach
The gallery of pixelsorted images and FFglitched videos can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/jxCPYYN). The theme for this gallery is, quite obviously once you stare at it, the beach. I think the images turned out pretty well, but the FFglitched videos turned out very well, I love the effect the beach has on the average motion vector method. Enjoy!
